It is really pretty just as shown in image but it has two cons. 1. The front portion is little narrow and may be uncomfortable to people with broad feet. 2. The heel is quite heavy and while walking it goes down faster than the foot portion making flap sound which I find a bit annoying,Negative
Super chic and comfortable. The heels are sturdy and give you a good grip.,Positive
Comfortable to wear; high quality heels. Looks great and goes well with any western attire,Positive

Review,Sentiment
"The iQOO Z9s Pro is a solid smartphone in this price range, offering a sleek and lightweight design, a smooth 120Hz AMOLED display, and powerful performance. However, there are some areas where it has minor drawbacks. Let‚Äôs break it down:

‚úÖ Design & Display

The phone has a sleek and stylish look, making it feel premium in hand.

It is lightweight, so holding and using it for long hours is comfortable.

The AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Outdoor visibility is great, so using it under sunlight is not a problem.

‚úÖ Performance & Heating

The powerful processor ensures smooth gaming and multitasking without lag.

Minimal heating during normal use. However, while charging, there is slight heat, but it‚Äôs not a major issue.

‚úÖ Camera Performance

Rear Camera:

Captures sharp and detailed photos.

Outdoor shots are impressive, with vibrant colors and good dynamic range.

Low-light performance is decent, with good details in night mode.

4K video recording is stable and works well.

Selfie Camera:

Just okay ‚Äì it‚Äôs not the best but still usable.

Works fine in good lighting but struggles in low light.

Indoor photos are just average, with decent quality but not as sharp as outdoor shots.

‚úÖ Battery & Charging

Battery easily lasts a full day on normal use.

Fast charging is super quick, but you might feel slight heat while charging.

‚úÖ Software & Features

Funtouch OS runs smoothly, with no major lags.

There are many pre-installed hot apps, but you can uninstall them one by one.

In-display fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive.

‚öñÔ∏è Final Verdict

If you are looking only for camera performance, you may consider other phones. However, if you want a well-balanced phone with great overall performance‚Äîcovering display, battery, design, and speed‚Äîthen the iQOO Z9s Pro is one of the best choices in this price range.

20 Days Experience with the Phone

It's been 20 days since I started using this phone, and I‚Äôve noticed a few things that I want to share.

Pros:

Battery: I think I haven‚Äôt experienced a phone with such great battery life before, especially with the flash charging feature. In just 35 minutes, the phone charges up to 85%, and with normal use, the battery can last for up to 2 days.

Display: The display quality is unmatched. Even with heavy gaming, it provides a smooth experience without any lag. BGMI runs at 60 FPS without issues.

No Heating Issues: You won‚Äôt encounter heating issues even during heavy tasks.

Feature-packed: This phone is loaded with features.

Performance: iQOO is well known for its gaming performance, and this phone lives up to that reputation.

Design: The phone has a unique design, resembling the iQOO 12. However, the camera module scratches easily if you don‚Äôt use a proper case. Unfortunately, when you use a protective case, it hides some of the design elements, especially the distinctive square module, which is disappointing.

Cons:

Camera: Both the rear and front cameras offer a poor experience. The photos are too natural‚Äîlacking saturation and quality. If you're looking for both performance and a good camera, this phone may not be for you. iQOO needs to improve the camera for future models. Despite the claim of using a Sony lens, the camera quality doesn‚Äôt reflect that.

Bloatware: There‚Äôs a significant amount of pre-installed bloatware, though most of it can be uninstalled.

Price: The price should be capped at ‚Çπ23K. At ‚Çπ25K, it doesn‚Äôt feel worth it because you‚Äôre only getting 8+128 GB with LPDDR 4x and UFS 2.1 storage‚Äîspecs you can find in ‚Çπ20K phones like Lava or Moto.

Conclusion:

Overall, I‚Äôd rate this phone 4.5 out of 5. The camera needs improvement, and the phone is a bit overpriced. However, if you can get it during a festive sale, it might be worth it.

Thank you.üôè ALOK RAWAT ‚≠ê‚ù§Ô∏è
